Query: Which psychological principles influenced design insights?
Latency: 4.723s
Response: {'answer': 'The "Psychological Principles" section was crucial in guiding Nishad\'s design insights! He identified several key principles at play. **Control Discrimination** was a big one, as the identical chains forced users to rely on memory. **Visual Perception** also came into play, as it’s tricky to judge fan speed accurately. **Memory** was challenged because users needed to recall which chain controlled which function, and speed states, highlighting the lack of feedback mechanisms. **Bottom-Up Processing** and **Decision-Making** were other factors influencing the user\'s experience, as they had to make choices and struggle with the design.

He also stressed the importance of **mechanical feedback** to indicate the current speed. Furthermore, he suggested consistent visual design across fan models and enhancing the shorter chain’s visibility.
