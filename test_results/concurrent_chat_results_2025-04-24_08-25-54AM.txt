Latency: 2.842s
Response: {'answer': "Nishad's research highlighted several key psychological principles. The study found issues related to **control discrimination** (identical chains!), **visual perception** (judging the speed of the rotating blades), and **memory** (remembering which chain controlled which function and the speed states). The study also touched on **bottom-up processing** (how air movement and environment influence comfort) and **decision-making**, with the Hicks-Hyman Law explaining longer reaction times due to the number of choices. The research used these insights to suggest design improvements like icon-indicator systems and mechanical feedback.

Crucially, he emphasized **mechanical feedback** to signal the current speed. Other recommendations include maintaining consistent visual features across fan models and making the shorter chain more visible.
