Latency: 6.532s
Response: {'answer': 'Let\'s talk about the "psychological principles" section of Nishad\'s case study! This is where he really breaks down *why* those usability issues happened. He identified key principles like "Control Discrimination," where the identical chains made it hard for users to tell them apart, forcing them to rely on memory.\n\nHe also highlighted "Visual Perception" challenges, as judging the fan speed proved difficult. Memory played a role, too, since users needed to remember which chain did what. Finally, principles such as "Bottom-Up Processing" and "Decision-Making" were explored, showing how factors like environment and cognitive load influenced user performance.\n\nThe study\'s findings on these principles led to actionable design suggestions like an icon-indicator system and mechanical feedback, aiming to reduce reliance on memory and improve overall usability, as noted in the conclusion.
