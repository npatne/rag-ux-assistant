iSTART Early Mobile Application

Challenge
The primary challenge was to transition a robust educational tool from desktop to mobile, catering to children as young as grades 3 to 5.
This adaptation required a change in platform and a complete reimagining of how educational content is presented and interacted with on smaller screens.

Project Type
Mobile Application Design

Tech Stack
Figma, Pen-Paper, Dall-E, ChatGPT, Photoshop

My Role
UX and UI Designer

Stakeholder / Client
Personal Project, SoLET Lab, ASU

Process – Overview
Consider these as sections where I present my work, not in chronological order. I've moved back and forth at each step, iterating for improvement.

1. Research & Discovery
Explored learning science, mobile app impacts, and pedagogy. Emphasized empathy for students, parents, and teachers via research.

2. Definition & Ideation
Used desktop app insights to craft mobile features, AI integration, user flows, and UI sketches.

3. UI Design & Prototyping
Studied UI trends, adapted desktop style guides for mobile, created layouts and micro-interactions, acquired graphics assets to complete the prototype.

4. Conclusion & Future Directions
Focused on essential research and UI and UX design learnings. The UI undergoes internal testing at LEI, with user testing next.

iSTART Early: Case Study

Research and Discovery

Introduction
The iSTART* Early intelligent tutoring system, developed by the Science of Learning and Educational Technology (SoLET) Lab at Arizona State University, builds on extensive interdisciplinary research integrating psychology, linguistics, and computer science.
Directed by Danielle S. McNamara, the SoLET Lab specializes in creating advanced educational technologies, including game-based tutoring systems that enhance learning and comprehension for diverse student populations.

*Interactive Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking (iSTART)

160+ peer-reviewed research papers, 3 books spanning over 2 decades.

Where do I come in?
I started with the lab as a Product Designer (Specialist). I contributed (and still do) to iSTART Early by creating a color and brand guide, UI for desktop screens, educational games on Storyline 360, and CSS/SCSS themes.

Why a Mobile App When a Desktop Version Exists?
My work in Ed-tech, inspired by research including J. Breitwieser et al., motivated the creation of the iSTART Early mobile app.

The addition to mobile platforms leverages:
- Home Learning: Transforms educational tasks into engaging home activities.
- Parental Monitoring: Simplifies how parents track progress.
- Wider Reach: Expands access globally, even in areas with limited tech infrastructure.

"Mobile devices like smartphones and smartwatches are ubiquitous both inside and outside the classroom, but their potential for personalized education has yet to be realized."  
— Breitwieser et al. (2023), Mobile Interventions: An Untapped Potential for Education

Additions to iSTART Early
Adapting the desktop app to a mobile interface was challenging, but integrating AI through our pedagogical agent, Matty, truly enhanced the project:
- Pedagogical Agent – Matty: Positioned as the central feature, Matty brings a conversational AI experience to the forefront.
- AI Integration: This allows Matty to act more like a companion than a mere tool, significantly enhancing user interaction.

Feedback from my team—developers, product owners, and researchers—was crucial, driving iterative improvements and aligning the app with our educational objectives.

Definition and Ideation

What is Included – Features
With constant research on the concept of application in motion, I began listing and finalizing the features I planned to include:

1. Learning Management System (Student's View):
   - Overview dashboards
   - Strategy-based dashboards (depicted as planets)
   - Quiz UI
   - Assignment screen

2. Matty's Chat Interface:
   - Standalone chat interface
   - Floating popup for contextual questions

3. Utility Features:
   - Login, intro, and communication screens

User Flow and Flowchart
With features finalized, I created a flowchart to visualize the user flow.

Low-Fidelity Sketches
Utilized low-fidelity sketches to validate and visualize the application before detailed UI design:
- Application layout and UI patterns
- Microinteractions and feasibility checks
- Efficient planning of UI components and assets

UI Design and Prototype

Design Research
To engage young learners, I used a space-themed design and AI-driven interactivity:

- Space-Themed UI Design:
  A vibrant, immersive design aimed at sparking curiosity and creating an enjoyable learning experience.

- AI-Driven Interactivity:
  Featuring Matty, the AI pedagogical agent, offering a personalized, conversational learning experience.

- Graphic Asset Creation with AI:
  Leveraged DALL·E to generate space-themed graphics including our mascot Matty.

UI Design
After thorough research, I began designing the final UI in Figma. The process included several iterations, but the final stills showcase the polished result.

Prototype
The complete prototype is functional and visually aligned with the educational and emotional goals of the project.

Conclusion and Next Steps

Prototype and Future Directions
With the first prototype phase complete, next steps include:
- Enhancing features: profile management, incentives, lesson delivery, and educational games.
- Continued collaboration with the team for refinement.

Reflection
Designing iSTART Early was a multifaceted challenge blending creativity, pedagogy, and technology. As a UX designer, I wore many hats—from researcher to artist.

Looking Ahead – Research
Next, I aim to introduce the mobile app to students and conduct focus group studies, usability tests, and learnability evaluations. This project goes beyond UI—it’s about crafting an accessible, fun, and educational companion for young learners.
