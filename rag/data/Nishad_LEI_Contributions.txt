* Conducted Quality Assurance testing, discovering and documenting bugs and potential enhancements in the WAT interface—link to Airtable Bug Log. 
* Orchestrated internal usability testing to understand initial impressions about the tool outside the development team. The test was a self-paced and self-reported task-based walkthrough of the application. It generated insightful feedback about thematic enhancements and quick improvements while also directing further enhancements & research—link to Final Presentation. 
* Designed and implemented (CSS) a comprehensive color and typography system to support the application's scaling up while ensuring visual consistency.
* Co-facilitated the Focus group study involving external participants (ASU Teachers) to investigate how the WAT generated Metric feedback is interpreted and how representative users perceive the UI. This study influenced significant upgrades in the application's WAT Feedback and rubric UX and UI and established the foundation of the research paper submitted to LAK2025.
