INTRODUCTION:
Ceiling fans are widely used in residential and commercial spaces to enhance thermal comfort through air movement. Studies indicate that air movement increases perceived thermal comfort in warmer temperatures by promoting perspirative evaporation (Present et al., 2019). While ceiling fans have been studied for their energy efficiency, their usability remains underexplored. 

A 2013 survey found that the average U.S. household owns three ceiling fans with light kits, with 57% controlled by wall switches for power and pull chains for light and speed control (Kantner et al., 2013). Despite the rise of smart fans, a large portion of the population continues to use pull-chain-controlled fans. This study examines pull-chain-controlled ceiling fans from a usability perspective, explores the psychological principles affecting user experience, and proposes design improvements.

EXPERIMENT SETUP:
The study was conducted in a closed room with ambient temperature, using a Hampton Bay 52-inch Rothley II ceiling fan. The fan has:
- Five blades.
- A center-mounted light kit.
- Two identical metal-ball pull chains, differing only in length:
  - The shorter chain controls the fan speed: low (first pull), medium (second pull), high (third pull).
  - The longer chain controls the light: alternating between on and off with each pull.

PARTICIPANTS:
- Five university students (four male, one female).
- Varying levels of prior experience with ceiling fans.

STUDY PROCEDURE:
1. **Pre-Test Interview:**
   - What types of ceiling fan controls have you used?
   - How long have you used them?
  
2. **Task Description:**
   - The fan’s power supply was left on.
   - The fan and light were initially off.
   - Participants had to identify the pull chain for speed control and set the fan to medium speed.

3. **Post-Test Interview:**
   - Why did you pull this chain first?
   - How was your experience using this fan?

OBSERVATIONS:
- Average task duration: 8 minutes (including pre/post-test interviews).
- Pre-test findings:
  - All participants had used wall-mounted regulators for over 15 years.
  - Three had used remote-controlled fans.
  - All had been exposed to pull-chain fans for at least four months, but only two claimed familiarity.
- Task performance:
  - One participant failed to identify the speed settings correctly.
  - Two participants initially pulled the wrong chain, activating the light before correcting their action.
  - Four participants struggled to judge speed differences and recall previous speed settings.
- Post-test responses:
  - Participants expressed discomfort with pull-chain controls.
  - Difficulty in perceiving speed differences and recalling previous states contributed to frustration.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES:

1. **Control Discrimination:**
   - Effective usability requires controls to be identifiable, accessible, and distinguishable (Lee et al., 2017).
   - The fan chains were identical except for length, forcing users to rely on memory.
   - Research suggests that a single distinguishing factor (e.g., spatial positioning) is insufficient; redundancy through multiple cues (color, icons, labels) is recommended (Thompson & Markson, 1998).

2. **Visual Perception:**
   - Users must judge blade rotation speed and compare it with previous states.
   - Human ability to perceive rotational motion is constrained by perspective and reference frames (Pani et al., 1995).
   - Misalignment between the user's visual angle and the fan’s rotation plane reduces perceptual accuracy (Massironi & Luccio, 1989).

3. **Memory:**
   - Users must recall which chain controls which function.
   - They must also encode and recall speed states without visual indicators.
   - Human memory is weak at encoding rotational motion, leading to errors (Price & Gilden, 2000).
   - The absence of feedback mechanisms increases reliance on memory, contributing to user dissatisfaction.

4. **Bottom-Up Processing:**
   - Air movement affects thermal perception, which varies based on ambient temperature (Toftum, 2004).
   - Perceived comfort differs between warm and cold environments, influencing decision-making.
   - Environmental factors, individual sensitivity, and gender can introduce bias, making air velocity an unreliable cue for judging speed states (Todde, 2000; Present et al., 2019).

5. **Decision-Making:**
   - Users struggled to determine the correct chain and speed setting.
   - Increased cognitive load and uncertainty in available choices led to longer reaction times.
   - The difficulty aligns with the Hicks-Hyman Law, which states that reaction time increases with the number of possible choices (Hyman, 1953).
   - Poor design forced users to rely on weakly encoded memory, making decision-making error-prone (Memelink & Hommel, 2012).

DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS:
- Introduce an **icon-indicator system** near the speed control chain.
- Display speed states (low = 1, medium = 2, high = 3, off = 0) for immediate recognition.
- Ensure **mechanical feedback** to indicate the current speed state.
- Maintain consistent visual features (shape, color, placement) across all fan models.
- Reduce reliance on memory by **promoting recognition over recall** (Roediger, 1990).
- Increase control salience by enhancing the **shorter chain’s visibility and differentiation**.

CONCLUSION:
- Despite prolonged exposure, participants found pull-chain ceiling fans **difficult to use**.
- Major usability issues stemmed from **control discrimination, weak memory encoding, and poor feedback**.
- **Accidental control activation** and **difficulty perceiving speed states** led to frustration.
- A simple **icon-indicator system** could significantly improve usability without altering mechanical functionality.
- Future research should explore **ergonomic ceiling fan designs** with a larger sample size.
