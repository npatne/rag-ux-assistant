User Experience Research and Recommendations
Researcher and Presenter: Nishad Anil Patne
Paani Foundation – www.paanifoundation.in

Executive Summary
Goals:
To conduct multi-method user experience research to discover usability issues and provide design recommendations backed by empirical findings.

Reasons for Recommendation:
- Addresses issues identified through usability testing and research.
- Issues are feasible to prototype and test.
- Impacts large areas of the website.
- Aligns design improvements with Nielsen’s Heuristics.

Recommendations:
- Implement an improved 3-level navigation system.
- Create a dedicated Activities/Our Work page.
- Enhance Contact Us page with better form validations.

Key Findings:
- Stakeholder Analysis
- Heuristic Evaluation
- Survey-Based User Research (19 responses)
- Scenario-Based Usability Testing (5 representative users, 3 tasks)

Major Issues:
- Website Navigation
- Content Hierarchy and Organization
- Contact Us Section

Research Objectives
Purpose:
Understand user interaction with the Paani Foundation desktop site and enhance overall UX.

Scope:
- User Expectations
- Navigation
- UI & Design
- Content Grouping
- Forms
- Site Performance

Expected Outcomes:
- Better understanding of current users
- Discovery of usability issues
- Data-backed prototypes to fix them

Organizational Outcomes:
- Present foundation’s work in a better format
- Easier ways for users to connect
- Broader awareness of drought issues

Research Methodology
1. Heuristic Evaluation:
   - Used Nielsen’s 10 heuristics and rated issues by severity (Level 1–4).
   - 8 out of 20 issues validated in later tests.
   - 5 of those integrated into final recommendations.

2. User Research:
   - Conducted a survey with 19 responses.
   - Created personas and mapped them to user stories and acceptance criteria.

3. Usability Testing:
   - 3 scenarios, 5 participants.
   - Each tested tasks aligned with user stories.
   - Tests conducted and recorded via Zoom.

Scenarios Overview:
Scenario 1: Discover activities the foundation engages in.
Scenario 2: Find beneficiary details and press articles.
Scenario 3: Try connecting with the foundation and subscribe using faulty data.

Results & Findings
Quantitative Results:
- 11 major usability issues discovered.
- Most common issues: poor navigation, lack of structure, misplaced “Contact Us.”
- 100% could find activity info but not press or beneficiary content easily.
- Long page load times frustrated 4 of 5 participants.

Common UX Problems:
- Navigation system mismatch with user expectations.
- Footer content underutilized.
- Contact info not visible where expected.
- Poor email validation.
- Lack of alt-text on images (accessibility).
- Confusing UI hierarchy.
- Preference for infographics over video links.

Impact on Recommendations
While the UI aesthetics were praised, key UX issues required redesign:

1. Navigation (High Priority)
   - Add global nav bar, contextual secondary nav, and breadcrumb tertiary nav.
   - Move critical links like "Contact Us" out of footer.

2. Our Work Section (Low Priority)
   - Combine all activities under one page.
   - Support with visual summaries and CTA buttons.

3. Contact Us Page (Medium Priority)
   - Relocate link to primary nav.
   - Add hover states to icons, improve email visibility.
   - Add better form validation and clear error messages.

Conclusion and Next Steps
- Paani Foundation’s UI is visually strong, but UX suffers due to structural issues.
- Prototype solutions provided for navigation, “Our Work,” and contact page.
- UX is iterative — recommend repeated testing and refinement until satisfactory.

Steps:
1. A/B test current vs. proposed prototype
2. Evaluate performance of changes
3. Iterate if problems persist or new ones emerge
