Test Overview

Introduction
The Writing Analytics Tool (WAT) is currently in development, boasting a robust set of features.
This stage offers an ideal opportunity to align our vision with user needs, allowing us to test and refine the product as we continue to enhance its capabilities in each iteration.

Why test?
- Bias Elimination due to internal team very closely associated with the app. 
- Understanding User Perception
- Uncovering not just problems but opportunities for improvement.

- Designed and Implemented Style Guide
- Redesigned major user flows
- Discovered several Edge Cases and Potential Enhancements
- Discovered Loopholes

Testing Methodology
- Google Form: To gain objective and subjective insights about overall UI.
- Test Case Sheet: Guided Walkthrough to navigate test while collecting crucial task-specific data (comments, ratings, times and outcomes).
- Material distributed and collected over email, unique credentials for each participant.

Timeline

Findings and Recommendations

Quantitative Findings (N = 14)
- Max Task Time: (5 min) Assignment Creation 
- Usability Score < 3: Adding Students, Selecting Metrics, Publishing Assignment
- Complexity Score > 3: Assignment Creation

1. Assignment Creation Flow
  Issues:
    - Evaluative and Descriptive Metrics
    - Logical Validations (min - max length, draft dates)
    - Publishing the Assignment step is confusing!
    - No cancel/back button

  Recommendations:
    - Highlight selected metric
    - Merge tabs, show frequently used metrics at top, rest collapsible
    - Dynamic Action center for publish/unpublish buttons
    - Add cancel button and breadcrumbs

2. Adding Students
  Issues:
    - Teacher counted as a student
    - Cannot select all students

  Recommendations:
    - Provide entry to class from student view on card
    - Add “select all” checkbox, retain across pages/filters

3. Feedback Flow
  Issues:
    - Feedback icon unclear
    - No search for students
    - Feedback stems cluttered
    - Additional comments section unclear

  Recommendations:
    - Keep feedback icon, add status indicators
    - Add search/filter by student/feedback
    - Structured feedback text, formatting options

Application-wide Issues

1. Validations
    - 404/400 error pages
    - Custom validations for characters, new lines, filetypes
    - Logical validations (e.g., draft date order)

2. UX Copy
    - Clearer names for pages, headings, tables, breadcrumbs
    - Consistency in language
    - Contextual buttons in modals (e.g., delete confirmation)

3. Responsive UI
    - General responsiveness improvement suggestions

Participant-Suggested Enhancements
1. Search for prompt selection
2. Auto-save on accidental logout
3. Auto-transition to WAT score
4. Seamless student-instructor mode transition
5. Synchronize Student and Teacher calendars
6. Color-coded status indicators
7. Define "mentor text" and "rubrics"

Conclusion

Limitations
- Self-reported, unproctored test may introduce bias
- Participants not fully representative of end users

Next Steps
1. Decide and implement issue fixes
2. Further testing with teachers/TAs
3. Test for scale (many submissions across classes)
4. Test for interpretation of WAT Scores
5-7. Open to suggestions…
