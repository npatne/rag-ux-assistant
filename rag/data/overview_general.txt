#Project Overviews

##1. Writing Analytics Tool (WAT)

Summary: Transformed a rudimentary, developer-built MVP into a user-centric educational platform by leading end-to-end UX design, research, and strategy.
My Role: Lead UX Designer.
Challenge: The tool's powerful NLP analytics were unusable for teachers and students due to a rudimentary UI, unclear feedback, and inconsistent flows.
Key Contributions & Outcomes: Created a scalable design system (Figma & CSS). Led user research (focus groups) that directly pivoted product strategy. Redesigned core features like rubric creation and analytics interpretation, introducing a novel Likert-scale feedback system. Contributed to a LAK2025 academic paper and documented 50+ bugs/enhancements. Gained strategic influence in the product's future direction.
Technologies & Methods: Figma, CSS, Focus Groups, Usability Testing, Qualitative Analysis, Asana, Airtable, Cross-functional collaboration.

##2. WAT Researcher: Desktop-First Platform

Summary: Spearheaded a critical strategic pivot from a failing web-first strategy to a powerful desktop application, single-handedly designing and engineering the new full-stack solution.
My Role: Sole UX Designer & Full-Stack Engineer.
Challenge: The initial web-based strategy for a text analysis tool was found to be prohibitively expensive and unscalable due to computationally intensive backend processes. The project was at risk of failure.
Key Contributions & Outcomes: Identified the strategic flaw, proposed the pivot to a desktop-first solution, and got it approved. Designed the entire UX and architected a superior project-based workflow. Single-handedly developed the full-stack application (Angular, Django/Python) and packaged it for macOS/Windows (Electron, PyInstaller). This move saved the institute significant costs and established a new desktop development capability.
Technologies & Methods: Angular, Django, Python, Electron, PyInstaller, SQLite, Figma, Strategic Pivoting.

##3. iSTART Early: Gamified Learning Ecosystem

Summary: Led the UX architecture for a large-scale NLP-powered learning platform, building the Teacher Portal from scratch, overhauling the Student Hub, and developing numerous interactive learning modules.
My Role: UX Architect & Practice Leader.
Challenge: The platform had a three-front problem: no teacher-facing tools, a disjointed student experience, and learning modules that were functionally isolated from the main hub.
Key Contributions & Outcomes: Architected and designed the entire Teacher Portal. Redesigned the Student Hub. Personally developed 5+ complex interactive modules in Articulate Storyline, writing custom JavaScript to bridge data to the main Angular platform. Engineered a design system with an automated token pipeline (Token Studio), improving development efficiency by 40%. The resulting platform is now the foundation for grant-funded academic research. Also explored a future-vision mobile app concept powered by AI.
Technologies & Methods: Figma, Token Studio, Articulate Storyline 360, JavaScript, CSS, Usability Testing, Stakeholder Interviews.

##4. AI-Powered Portfolio Chatbot

Summary: A self-directed project to build a conversational RAG AI chatbot for his portfolio, demonstrating mastery of modern AI engineering principles and strategic problem-solving.
My Role: Solo Design Engineer & AI Architect.
Challenge: A traditional portfolio is a static, one-way medium. The goal was to create a dynamic, conversational layer for exploration. A critical challenge was pivoting from an initial, unscalable self-hosted model to a robust API-driven architecture.
Key Contributions & Outcomes: Designed and built a complete RAG system from the ground up. Made a pragmatic and well-documented pivot from a flawed self-hosted Llama model to a scalable architecture using Gemini Pro, Qdrant, and Haystack. Successfully deployed the application on Oracle Cloud. Transformed a static portfolio into an interactive, dialogue-driven tool.
Technologies & Methods: RAG, Gemini Pro LLM, Haystack, Qdrant Vector Database, Python, Oracle Cloud, Next.js.


##5. Paani Foundation Website Redesign

Summary: A foundational academic project involving a comprehensive UX research study for a real-world non-profit, leading to data-backed design recommendations.
My Role: UX Researcher (Independent).
Challenge: The website had poor navigation and information architecture, making it difficult for users to find key information like activity details, press articles, and contact info.
Key Contributions & Outcomes: Conducted heuristic evaluation, user surveys (19 responses), and moderated usability testing (5 users). Identified 11 usability issues, with navigation being the root cause of 5. Delivered high-fidelity prototypes and prioritized recommendations that earned stakeholder praise and a teaching assistant position.
Technologies & Methods: Nielsen's Heuristics, Figma, Google Forms, Persona Development, Moderated Usability Testing, Quantitative Analysis.

##6. Ceiling Fan Pull-Chain Controls: A Human Factors Study

Summary: An academic research project analyzing the usability flaws of a common household product through the lens of cognitive psychology and human factors principles.
My Role: Human Factors Researcher.
Challenge: Pull-chain fans cause user frustration due to poor control discrimination and reliance on faulty human perception of motion.
Key Contributions & Outcomes: Conducted a 5-person usability study, synthesized findings with academic literature on memory and perception, and authored a research paper. Proposed a feasible icon-indicator system to reduce cognitive load. The study found a 40% initial error rate and 100% user discomfort.
Technologies & Methods: Human factors analysis, usability testing protocols, academic literature synthesis, psychological principle application.

##7. Jerry the Junior Research AIde

Summary: A conceptual enterprise project to design a comprehensive research management platform for academic researchers.
My Role: UX Designer (in a team of two).
Challenge: Academic researchers use scattered tools, leading to fragmented workflows and chaotic data management.
Key Contributions & Outcomes: Conducted researcher interviews to identify pain points. Designed the complete information architecture, user flows, and mid-fidelity prototypes for 10 core features. Developed a custom design system based on Material Design 3. The project became a key portfolio piece demonstrating enterprise UX capabilities.
