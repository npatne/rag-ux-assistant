Here's a taste of what Nishad has been up to:

**Leading the Charge on Learning Analytics:** He's been crucial in designing a powerful tool called "Writing Analytics Tool" (WAT), crafting interactive prototypes, fixing bugs, conducting usability tests (and the presentations that came with them!), and even building a consistent visual style guide (colors and typography) for the application. He also helped lead studies, including a focus group with ASU teachers, that directly informed improvements to WAT's feedback and user interface.

Query 7: Give me an overview of the Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research.
Answer: Ever wrestled with a pull-chain ceiling fan? This research dives into why they can be so frustrating!  The study found that even though people use these fans all the time, they often struggle with them.  Participants had trouble telling which chain controlled what, struggled to remember fan speeds, and generally felt annoyed.  The researchers pinpointed the problems: it's hard to tell the chains apart, our memories aren't great at remembering the speed settings, and the lack of clear feedback makes things worse.  

But there's a simple fix: adding an **icon-indicator system** showing speed settings (like "1, 2, 3") and making the speed chain more easily identifiable. This would significantly improve the user experience!

**Want to know more?** Did the study consider different fan designs?  How would it apply to smart fans?  What about the impact of light level on perception?  Let's explore the details!

Query 8: What was the internal usability finding in iSTART Early?
Answer: The internal usability test of the iSTART Early web application, conducted in November-December 2024, revealed several key findings, primarily focused on the Teacher's Interface. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Positive Aspects:** Participants generally found the application's layout clean and intuitive.
*   **Key Usability Issues:**
    *   **UX Copy:** A significant area of concern was the quality of the user interface copy. Participants noted issues with:
        *   Inconsistent verbiage (e.g., phrasing in messages and labels)
        *   Misaligned tone
        *   Grammatical errors
        *   Unclear labels
        *   Missing or unhelpful tooltips
    *   **Navigation:** Some aspects of the navigation were unclear or inconsistent. One specific example was the placement of the "Create Classroom" feature.
    *   **Development Bugs:** Several development-related issues were identified:
        *   Progress tracking and synchronization problems between the Teacher and Student interfaces.
        *   Notification container opacity issues (making text hard to read).
        *   Bugs in class creation.
    *   **Engagement:** The monotone lesson voices were noted as potentially disengaging for younger students.

*   **Recommendations:** The primary recommendation was to overhaul the UX copy to ensure clarity, consistency, and helpfulness. This included improving headings, labels, navigation elements, confirmation messages, and tooltips.

The goal of the test was to identify areas for improvement before a broader usability test.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these findings or discuss potential solutions?

Query 10: What did Nishad recommend for the Paani Foundation website?
Answer: Nishad Patne's UX research and recommendations for the Paani Foundation website focused on improving the user experience, despite the website having strong visual appeal. Here's a breakdown:

**Key Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Navigation:**
    *   The main focus was to improve the website's navigation which was confusing.
    *   This involved implementing a 3-level navigation system. This likely includes a global navigation bar (top), contextual secondary navigation (perhaps within sections), and breadcrumb navigation (for deeper pages).
    *   Moving important links like "Contact Us" from the footer to a more prominent place.
*   **Our Work/Activities Section:**
    *   Creating a dedicated "Activities/Our Work" page to combine all the foundation's activities.
    *   Supporting this with visual summaries and call-to-action (CTA) buttons to encourage user engagement.
*   **Contact Us Page:**
    *   Relocating the "Contact Us" link to the primary navigation for better visibility.
    *   Adding hover states to icons for better user interaction.
    *   Improving email visibility for easier access.
    *   Implementing better form validation and clear error messages to avoid user frustration.

**Why These Recommendations?**

The recommendations were driven by the following:

*   **Usability Testing:** Results from scenario-based usability testing (5 users, 3 tasks) highlighted specific problems.
*   **User Research:** A survey (19 responses) provided insights into user behavior and expectations.
*   **Heuristic Evaluation:** Applying Nielsen's usability heuristics pinpointed design flaws.
*   **Addressing Key Issues:** These recommendations tackle the identified major issues of poor navigation, lack of content structure, and problems with the "Contact Us" section.

**Next Steps:**

Nishad recommended iterative improvements, starting with A/B testing the current website vs. the proposed prototype, and then evaluating the performance of the changes and iterating again to address any persistent or new issues.

You can find the full documentation and research data here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KX-bNPvqhINNEFFjgdH8OY3moq1mLrg7AJcJZeXaA-g](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KX-bNPvqhINNEFFjgdH8OY3moq1mLrg7AJcJZeXaA-g)
