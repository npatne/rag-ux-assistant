Response: {'answer': 'Okay, let\'s recap Nishad\'s "Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research"! The motivation was to investigate the usability of pull-chain ceiling fans, which are still commonly used, even with the rise of smart fans. The study aimed to understand user interactions and identify areas for improvement.\n\nThe setup involved five students and a standard Hampton Bay fan. Participants were pre-interviewed, tasked with setting the fan to medium speed, and then interviewed again.

Query: Which psychological principles influenced design insights?
Latency: 7.890s
Response: {'answer': "You've got it! Focusing on the 'psychological principles' section, Nishad's work really highlights some crucial areas. The study revealed issues related to **Control Discrimination**, with identical chains causing confusion. This connects directly to **Memory**, as users struggled to recall which chain controlled which function. Think about it: they had to *remember* rather than *recognize*.\n\nThe research also brought in **Visual Perception**; judging the fan's speed is harder than you'd think! Finally, **Decision-Making** played a role, as users struggled to choose the correct chain and speed, resulting in longer reaction times. Isn't it fascinating how these principles impact our everyday interactions with even simple devices like a fan?\n", 'sources': ['Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'], 'mode': 'specific', 'fallback': False, 'gif_url': None, 'steps': ['Retrieval Mode: specific', "Initial Filters: {'field': 'meta.title', 'operator': '==', 'value': 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'}"]}

Query: Were there recommended design improvements?
Latency: 6.428s
Response: {'answer': "Absolutely! In the 'Design Improvements' section, Nishad focused on practical solutions. He suggested an **icon-indicator system** to show speed states, making them immediately recognizable – that's a great example of using visual cues! He also proposed **mechanical feedback** to indicate the current speed, which tackles the memory challenges directly. He even mentions maintaining consistent visual features across fan models and enhancing the visibility of the speed control chain, making it easy to use.
