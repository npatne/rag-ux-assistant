Latency: 62.549s
Response: {'answer': 'Okay, let\'s dive into Nishad\'s "Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research"! The main goal was to investigate the usability of pull-chain ceiling fans, which, despite the rise of smart fans, are still widely used. Nishad wanted to explore how people interact with these fans and identify areas for improvement.\n\nThe study involved five university students, using a standard Hampton Bay fan. They were interviewed beforehand, tasked with setting the fan to medium speed, and then interviewed again afterward. The research focused on how well users could identify the controls and manage the fan\'s speed.\n', 'sources': ['Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'], 'mode': 'specific', 'fallback': False, 'gif_url': None, 'steps': ['Retrieval Mode: specific', "Initial Filters: {'field': 'meta.title', 'operator': '==', 'value': 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'}"]}

Query: Which psychological principles influenced design insights?
Latency: 13.152s
Response: {'answer': "Alright! Let's focus on the psychological principles section of Nishad's case study. This is where things get really interesting, right?\n\nNishad identified several principles. For example, under **Control Discrimination**, he noted how the identical chains forced users to rely on memory, leading to errors. This directly relates to **Memory**, where users had to remember which chain controlled what and the current speed state, which proved difficult. The study also touched on **Visual Perception**, explaining how our ability to judge fan speed is affected by perspective. Finally, **Decision-Making** played a role, as users struggled to choose the correct chain and speed setting, increasing their reaction times.\n\nThese insights led to some smart design improvements like icon-indicator systems, mechanical feedback, and promoting recognition over recall! What do you think of those suggestions?\n", 'sources': ['Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'], 'mode': 'specific', 'fallback': False, 'gif_url': None, 'steps': ['Retrieval Mode: specific', "Initial Filters: {'field': 'meta.title', 'operator': '==', 'value': 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'}"]}

Query: Were there recommended design improvements?
Latency: 23.568s
Response: {'answer': "Yes! In the 'Design Improvements' section, Nishad recommends some excellent changes. He suggested introducing an icon-indicator system to display speed states (low=1, medium=2, high=3, off=0) for immediate recognition, promoting recognition over recall. He also proposed mechanical feedback to indicate the current speed, which is brilliant! Additionally, he emphasized the importance of consistent visual features across models and enhancing the visibility of the speed control chain, making them easier to differentiate. These changes directly address the identified usability issues.\n", 'sources': ['Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research', 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'], 'mode': 'specific', 'fallback': False, 'gif_url': None, 'steps': ['Retrieval Mode: specific', "Initial Filters: {'field': 'meta.title', 'operator': '==', 'value': 'Pull-Chain Fan Usability Research'}"]}
