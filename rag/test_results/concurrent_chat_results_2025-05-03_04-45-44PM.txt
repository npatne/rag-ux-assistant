Query: Which psychological principles influenced design insights?
Latency: 4.883s
Response: {'answer': "Focusing on the 'psychological principles' section, Nishad's work highlights key cognitive aspects of usability. He pointed out the difficulties arising from **Control Discrimination** due to identical chains. This links directly to **Memory**, as users had to *recall* instead of *recognize* chain functions, leading to errors. The research also incorporated **Visual Perception**, showing that judging fan speed isn't as straightforward as it seems.
